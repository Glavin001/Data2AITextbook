    "input_text = \"\"\"Alright. Today, I'd like to talk to you about how to build an MVP or a minimum viable product. So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\"\"\""

      "So imagine that you are a person and your hair is on fire right now as you're watching this. Now imagine if I was sitting in the room next to you. What is the thing that you wish I could sell you to solve this problem? Your hair's currently on fire. Probably most of you will think some version of a bucket of water, a hose, some kind of water thing. Now that is a great product. That's like the iPhone today. That would solve your product immediately. I don't have that. I'm a founder. I've got an MVP. What I'm selling is a brick. Now what would you do if I was selling you a brick? Now some of you are like, well, I would, you know, would leave the room, like I couldn't use a brick. Bullshit, your hair's on fire. You would buy that brick, and you would hit yourself on the head with the brick to smother the fire. That's an MVP. It's not the perfect solution but you are in so much pain as a customer, you will use a non perfect solution to solve your problem. That's the customer you should be going after. For customers who are not desperate, you can wait. You don't have to go after them now. Just go after the desperate ones first, it'll make your life a lot easier. Now I I know some of you, especially those who've gone to business school. I know a lot of you have said, I can skip this step. Instead of building an MVP, iterating, iterating, why don't I just survey my users? Why don't I just talk to a hundred users and they'll tell me what to build. I wish this is the case. I wish that users could just tell you what to build, And then if you built those things, it'd win. In fact, I think every business wished that was the case. Here's the problem. Your customers are experts in their problem, but they actually don't have all of the answers on how to solve their problem. That's your job. That's the job of the person who's building a new product. Servies might help you understand the pain that your customer is going to but they will never help you figure out how to solve that pain. The only time that you start having that conversation with the customer is when you can put a product in front of them, preferably a crappy MVP, and start saying, does this solve your problem? I haven't really seen a shortcut to this step. I haven't seen a shortcut of building something pretty fast. That's pretty crappy. To get started. And even for larger companies, even for enterprise software companies, if you go back in time, the first versions of their product They were not perfect. They were far from it. They were the minimum that those customers were willing to use. So across the entire board, you gotta start with the minimum viable product. I think 1 of the most important points that I want to leave leave you with is that you don't start your startup with all the answers. Building a startup, especially the first phase of building a startup pre product market fit, is all about learning. It's all about taking some of the insights that you start with, bringing them to the market, and learning. Most of the solutions most of the best parts of product to use today were discovered after those products were launched when those founders were learning from their users. And building and launching MVP is the fastest way to start the process of learning. And the faster you learn, the more likely you are to build something that people love before anyone else.\n"

      "So let's say I've convinced you that now you actually want to build an MVP. How do you make sure you do it quickly? Here are some tricks. 1, give yourself a very specific deadline. It's a lot easier to make sure that you're building something that's a viable product if you give yourself 2 weeks or a month or a month and a half to complete it versus if you don't give yourself a deadline. Second, write down your spec. If you think that there are 5 or 10 features required, in order to launch an MVP, write them all down, don't put yourself in the position where you're constantly trying to figure out, should we have that feature, should we not have that feature I don't remember the feature we talked about the other day, how should it look, how should it work. If you write it down, then you can just focus on building instead of continuously debating what should be built. Number 3, cut that spec. After you write all that stuff down, go through each 1 of those items and ask yourself there's a truly desperate customer need that feature to start. You're probably surprised at how many features you can leave off for the second, third, or fourth version of your product. And just get the basic stuff out first. And the number 4 and most important, don't fall in love with your MVP. It's gonna change. You're gonna iterate it. It's going to get very, very, very different over time. You wanna do it fast and you don't wanna fall in love with it, You wanna fall in love with your customer, with your user, not in love with the crappy initial product that you're building to start learning from that user.\n"

      "Now 1 of the things we have to work on at YC a lot is fear, and this is the biggest fear that founders have is a nonspecific fear of, oh my God, if I give people my product and they don't like it, boom, my company dies. And it's always like hilarious because when we think about this, it's like, well, your company doesn't actually die. Right? Like, it doesn't die tomorrow. It's not like game over haven't run out of money. All your co founders are gonna quit. Whenever we encounter these fear scenarios, we like to dig in and kind of ask like, well, what would actually it. Like imagine the worst case scenario, you do talk to a customer, you do demo your product, it doesn't work. They don't wanna use it. You wake up the next day, but is anything that different? Can't you reach out to someone else? Can't you reach back out to that customer demo to a week later when you've made the product better, is your startup actually dead? More often than not, when you have this fear What you should be doing is kind of leaning into it and asking yourself, is this fear real? Is my company actually going to die if this scary thing happens? And it's not bad to feel the fear, but it is bad to act on it. It is bad to spend 1 year building your MVP because you're afraid the first customer might not like it. Now there's another group of folks who thinks I know what the perfect product is and I know it's going to take a year to build. Why would I build shitty versions of it? I like to call these folks fake Steve Jobs. And it's really a massive misconception of what great product people do. A lot of people thought of Steve Jobs as the kind of person who could just imagine great product and his mind, and then bring them out into the world. But what's funny is that most of the time when people think about the products Steve Jobs is most known for, let's say the iPod and let's say the iPhone. You won't take enough time to look at all of the different iterations of those products over time. Often when someone tells me like, oh, well, you know, Steve Jobs released an amazing phone first time, I say, well, do you remember that the iPhone started without an App Store? Do you remember you couldn't take video with the first iPhone? Do you remember the first iPhone only had 2 g and not a 3 g, so really, really, really bad Internet. Like most people don't remember that. Most people, the iPhone that they actually think of as an iPhone was like the third or fourth iteration of the iPhone. The first version of the iPad had like an actual physical scrolling device where like and we get stuck into it and it would break all the time, even the great Steve Jobs, iterated his products over time. So If you find yourself being a fake steve jobs thinking I know exactly what the customer needs, I just need to raise 10000000 dollars spent a year building it and then launch it. Think again. Right? Like, if Steve Jobs needed multiple tries to get his products right, maybe you need to as well.\n"

      "In my head. So let's go through some examples. This is says, we are going to transform the relationship between individuals and information that sucks. The thing is we see this all the time. Number 1, all the nouns that you have see see down here are abstract, their ideas. I can't reproduce based off of this. Has 0 informational value. I still have to ask questions to answer the 3 nouns that I need to have. This is a bad description for a company. We will see stuff that starts like this when we ask describe what your company is gonna make. I don't even want to read it. But basically it starts talking about the story of the company where basically it's like in the beginning there was this problem and we're gonna go through this issue. Right? And then there's these bad guys and they showed up. But then who's gonna save us? We're finally here to say, and you're like, I have to read another thousand applications. That's not gonna work for me. This is the description on the actual application that Airbnb put to YC. Airbnb is the first online marketplace that lets travelers book rooms with locals instead of hotels. It's concise. It's descriptive. I understand what they're building, have a sense for what they're making, and then I can start thinking about my other 2 ideas of whether I'm excited about it, and then am I gonna like this team? Here's Dropbox. Synchronizes files across your or your team's computers. The thing about this is it's refreshing, but also there's no pretense. They don't they aren't playing defense. I see a lot of company descriptions where they're like, I'm worried about this or I've gotten this kind of feedback. And so they give up clarity to make themselves look bigger and blow themselves up or make themselves try to look more interesting. They're trying to protect themselves against something away ahead of time. And the whole problem is usually what it ends up doing is it brings me farther away from you, all that padding that you've put on yourself. Here's a description from a company in the current batch. Luminae is building x-ray vision for soldiers and first responders. We don't have to go deep into the details. I don't need to understand how they exactly do this, etcetera. This creates a foundation for my curiosity. Now I will start from here to try to figure out, oh, how do you do this? Is this the right team to do this? How far along are they? Do they have traction? Do they have customers? I start going down the route of asking all the right questions based off this 1 description. This is a good 1. Here's another 1. So Vahan in the current batch is building LinkedIn for the next billion Internet users. So doesn't perfectly connect me to what they're sort of making, but I'm intrigued. I'm excited about someone building in the LinkedIn. And I know it's some kind of social network for business people. And so now I'm curious about how. I don't need you to answer how in the description but I understand what you're doing. And then now I can start making questions in my head about like how would I evaluate whether this is working or successful or promising or not? This is the right team. Do they have a certain amount of traction, etcetera. It gets me on the right track. Now the reason I've used this example is because we have a lot of companies who try to use the x for y. And what I mean by that is, like, LinkedIn for whatever, or Uber for blank, or Airbnb for blank. And so that x for y is super useful, because it allows you to shortcut business model and some kind of complex behavior. Right? And then attach it to some other vertical or something that you're trying to make work. X or white is okay, but most people abuse it or do it incorrectly.\n"

So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\"\"\")"

    "res = extract_knowledge(\"\"\"Alright. Today, I'd like to talk to you about how to build an MVP or a minimum viable product. So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\"\"\")\n",

So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\"\"\")\n",

So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\"\"\")\n",

    "learning_objectives = extract_learning_objectives(\"\"\"Alright. Today, I'd like to talk to you about how to build an MVP or a minimum viable product. So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\"\"\")\n",

They could get out of the market quickly. Second, they all had very limited functionality. The third, and interestingly enough, all these contradicts appeal to a small set of users. These founders realized that just making something that a smog were people's love. Was far more important than making something that could address all the needs of all potential customers from day\n",

      "Learning Objective: Define MVP (minimum viable product)\n",
      "Today, we will focus on the topic of MVP, which stands for minimum viable product. An MVP is an essential concept in product development. It involves launching a product quickly and then iterating and improving it over time based on feedback from users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of an MVP is to start a conversation with the user and understand their needs and problems. It is not about creating a perfect product from the start, but rather about getting something in front of the user to learn from their experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contrary to what one might think, an MVP is not about spending a lot of time conducting surveys or user interviews, contacting competitors, or fundraising excessively. These activities can be distractions that do not contribute to the main goal of understanding the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key point to remember is that an MVP is a starting point. It may not work initially, but it provides a foundation for problem-solving and improving the product. The focus should be on launching quickly, gathering feedback, and iterating based on that feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, an MVP is a minimum viable product that is launched quickly to start a conversation with the user and gather valuable feedback. It is not about perfection from the beginning but about continuous improvement and problem-solving. Remember, the goal is to learn from the user and put a product in front of them to better understand their needs.\n",
      "Learning Objective: Explain the purpose of an MVP\n",
      "Today, we will be discussing the purpose of an MVP, or a minimum viable product. An MVP is a term that is commonly used when talking about building a new product. It refers to the idea of creating a basic version of the product that can be quickly launched and tested with customers. The goal of an MVP is to gather feedback and learn from users in order to improve the product over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best advice when building an MVP is to launch something quickly and iterate. This means getting a product into the hands of customers as soon as possible and then making improvements based on their feedback. It is important to remember that the initial version of the MVP may not work perfectly, but it serves as a starting point for starting a conversation with the user and understanding their needs and problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is common for founders to get caught up in activities such as surveys, user interviews, and competitor analysis. While these activities may seem productive, they do not prioritize the most important aspect of building an MVP, which is learning about the user's needs through the actual use of the product.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, an MVP is a way to start the conversation with the user and gather valuable feedback to improve the product over time. It is important to launch the product quickly, iterate based on user feedback, and focus on learning from actual usage rather than getting caught up in distractions.\n",
      "Learning Objective: Describe the Midwitt meme\n",
      "Today, we will discuss the Midwitt meme, which is often referenced when discussing the process of building a minimum viable product or MVP. The Midwitt meme portrays two types of founders: the Jedi founder and the first-time founder. The Jedi founder is depicted as someone who is highly intelligent and has extensive knowledge and experience in their field. On the other hand, the first-time founder is portrayed as someone who is new to the industry and lacks knowledge and experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interestingly, both the Jedi founder and the first-time founder can come to the right decision when it comes to building an MVP. The lesson here is that it's not always about being the smartest or most knowledgeable person in the room; rather, it's about taking action and launching something quickly. The best approach for building an MVP is to get a product into the hands of your customers as soon as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of launching an MVP is to learn from your customers and see if your product is helpful to them or not. It is important to iterate and improve the product based on the feedback received from the users. This emphasizes the idea that the true learning about your users begins when you put your product in front of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's worth noting that an MVP may not initially work as intended. Building an MVP is not about creating a perfect product right from the start. It is meant to start a conversation with the user and provide a starting point for solving their problems. The focus is on getting feedback, learning from users, and using that feedback to iterate and improve the product over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following the approach of launching an MVP and iterating on it based on user feedback, you can effectively develop and improve your product. It's important to avoid getting distracted by activities such as conducting excessive surveys, user interviews, or competing with other similar products. Instead, the key is to prioritize launching your product quickly and engaging in continuous improvement through iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the goal of an MVP is to start the conversation with users and solve their problems. It may not always work perfectly at first, but it provides valuable insights and serves as a foundation for building a successful product. By embracing the iterative process and actively learning from users, you can navigate the challenges of product development and find innovative solutions.\n"

      "Today, we will be discussing the contrast between a Jedi founder and an Idiot founder. These two types of founders have different approaches and understanding when it comes to building a minimum viable product (MVP).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Jedi founder is described as someone who is super intelligent and knowledgeable about the best practices. They may have years of experience and expertise in their field. They tend to work hard and strive for perfection in every aspect of their product. The Jedi founder believes that by carefully planning and executing every step, they can ensure success. However, this approach may not always be effective when it comes to creating an MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, we have the Idiot founder. This term may sound harsh, but it refers to a first-time founder who may lack experience and understanding of the process. This founder may not have a clear idea of what they are doing or the best practices to follow. While they may seem inexperienced, they often make the right decisions when it comes to an MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lesson here is that both types of founders can achieve success with their MVP. It is not purely dependent on intelligence or experience. The key concept to grasp is that the best way to approach an MVP is to launch something quickly and iterate on it over time. By getting a product into the hands of customers, founders can learn whether it helps them or not and make improvements based on that feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that getting user feedback and learning about their needs can only truly happen when a product is in front of them. This is the main point to understand about an MVP. It is not about spending excessive time on surveys, interviews, or competitor analysis. Those activities may seem productive, but they can often distract and delay the process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, it is essential to acknowledge that the first version of an MVP is unlikely to work perfectly. It is primarily meant to start a conversation with the user and understand how to solve their problems. The focus should be on iterating and improving based on user feedback rather than striving for immediate perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the contrast between a Jedi founder and an Idiot founder lies in their approach to building an MVP. Both types can achieve success by launching quickly and iteratively improving their product based on user feedback. It is important to prioritize user interaction and feedback over excessive planning and distractions. Remember, an MVP is a conversation starter and not necessarily the final solution.\n"

The MVP methodology advises against spending excessive time on surveys, user interviews, competitor analysis, fundraising, or hiring a large team. Although these activities may seem productive, they can distract founders from the core purpose of an MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental principle of an MVP is to put a product in the hands of customers as soon as possible. By doing so, founders can learn whether the product is helpful to users or not. It is through this interaction that founders gain insights into user behaviors and needs. The MVP is not expected to be a fully functional or successful solution; instead, it serves as a starting point for conversations with users and an opportunity to identify and address their problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the contrast between a Jedi founder and an Idiot founder revolves around their approach to building an MVP. Both founders can make informed decisions, but the key lies in launching a product quickly, learning from user feedback, and iterating the product over time. The focus should be on putting the product in front of users rather than getting lost in activities that may appear productive but do not contribute to the core learning process of the MVP.\n",

So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work. It's just the best way to start the conversation with the user and how you can solve their problems.\n",

      "A minimum viable product, or MVP, is an essential concept in the world of entrepreneurship and product development. It involves creating a basic version of a product or service with just enough features to satisfy early customers and gather feedback for future improvements. The goal of an MVP is to quickly launch something into the market and iterate based on user feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many times, founders get caught up in trying to do everything perfectly and overthinking every aspect of their product. However, the best advice is to avoid getting stuck in analysis paralysis and instead focus on getting a product into the hands of your customers as soon as possible. This allows you to start learning about your users and their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's important to understand that the MVP may not initially work perfectly or solve all the user's problems. In fact, it's quite likely that it won't. But that's not the main purpose of an MVP. Its primary function is to start a conversation with the user and gather valuable insights that can guide future iterations and improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "To build an MVP successfully, it's crucial to prioritize launching quickly and iterating based on user feedback. This means avoiding getting trapped in lengthy surveys, extensive competitor analysis, fundraising efforts, or hiring excessive teams. While these activities may seem important, they can actually distract you from the core purpose of an MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, the key to building an effective MVP is to put a product in front of your users and learn from their experiences. By doing so, you can gather valuable insights and iteratively improve your product over time. So, embrace the mindset of launching quickly, gathering feedback, and constantly iterating to create a product that truly addresses the needs of your customers.\n",

The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it.

      "The Midwitt meme is often used to describe two types of founders when it comes to building a minimum viable product (MVP). On one hand, there is the Jedi founder, who is highly intelligent and seems to know everything about what they are doing. And on the other hand, there is the first-time founder, who may not have much experience and may seem clueless. Surprisingly, both of these founders often come to the same conclusion when it comes to building an MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "The key advice here is to launch something quickly and then iterate on it. Rather than spending a lot of time on surveys, user interviews, competitor analysis, fundraising, and team building, it is more effective to get a product into the hands of your customers. This allows you to learn whether the product helps them or not and gives you the opportunity to improve it over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to note that the MVP you build is not likely to work perfectly right away. In fact, it is expected that there will be room for improvement. However, the purpose of an MVP is not to have a perfect product from the start. Instead, it serves as a starting point for a conversation with the user and helps you understand their problems better.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the next time you are building an MVP, remember to focus on launching quickly, iterating on the product based on user feedback, and putting it in the hands of your customers to learn about their needs. Avoid getting too caught up in surveys, interviews, and other distractions that may seem important but do not contribute to the key purpose of the MVP.\n",

So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it. That doesn't mean that the thing you build in MVP is gonna work. Right? It's probably not gonna work.

In this lesson, we will reflect on the ability to assess and prioritize tasks effectively in the context of building an MVP.\n",
      "\n",
      "When building an MVP, it is important to focus on the most essential tasks that will lead to valuable insights. Rather than getting caught up in activities like surveys, user interviews, competitor analysis, fundraising, or team building, it is crucial to prioritize the task of putting a product into the hands of your customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "By launching a product quickly, you can begin the conversation with your users and understand their needs. It's important to note that the initial version of your product might not work perfectly, but it serves as a starting point for gathering feedback and improving upon it.\n",
      "\n",
      "While it can be tempting to spend a lot of time gathering information and conducting extensive research before launching an MVP, it is often more effective to start small and iterate based on real user feedback. This approach allows you to learn directly from your users and make improvements that align with their needs.\n",
      "\n",
      "To assess and prioritize tasks effectively, it is important to stay focused on the goal of learning from your users. Avoid getting distracted by tasks that may seem important but do not directly contribute to understanding your users' needs and preferences.\n",

It features two founders: the Jedi, who is knowledgeable and tries to do everything right, and the idiot, who is a first-time founder with little knowledge.

      "The most important aspect of building a minimum viable product (MVP) is to put it in the hands of your customers as quickly as possible. This allows you to learn about their needs and iterate on your product over time. It is common for founders to believe that conducting surveys, user interviews, competitor analysis, and other activities will provide valuable insights. However, these activities can often be distractions from the most crucial point of an MVP, which is learning about your users through actual product usage. While it is likely that your initial MVP may not work perfectly, it serves as a starting point for a conversation with your users and helps you understand how you can solve their problems. Remember, launching quickly and iterating based on feedback is the key to success when building an MVP.\n",

So if you haven't seen this before, this is a meme that we love to talk about when trying to help founders with their MVP, It's called the Midwitt meme. The person who is the Jedi, the super intelligent, the founder who's doing all the best things, and knows all the best things. And the idiot, the first time founder, the founder who has no idea what's going on. Many times, these 2 founders will actually come to the right decision. Before for the founder who is really smart as trying to work really hard and do everything right. And so in this situation with the MVP, best advice is to actually launch something quickly and iterate. Get a product into the hands of your customers. And then learn whether it helps them or doesn't, and then iterate it, improve it over time. The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with. That it might appear like other smart things. But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it.

      "Assessing and prioritizing tasks is a crucial skill when building an MVP. It involves determining which tasks are most important and need to be completed first in order to successfully launch the product. By understanding the significance of each task and its impact on the end goal, you can effectively allocate your time and resources. It's essential to resist the temptation to get sidetracked by activities that may seem important but don't contribute directly to the development of the MVP. Instead, focus on launching something quickly and getting it into the hands of your customers. This allows you to gather valuable feedback and iterate on your product to better address their needs. Remember that an MVP is not expected to work perfectly from the start, but it serves as a starting point for conversations with users and helps you identify ways to solve their problems. So, prioritize tasks wisely and keep the end goal of your MVP in sight.\n"

Instead of getting caught up in conducting numerous surveys, user interviews, and competitor analysis, it is important to focus on launching something quickly and iterating based on customer feedback.

      "A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development. The two common types of founders, the experienced and the inexperienced or the \"Jedi\" and the \"idiot\" in our context, can both arrive at the right decision about the MVP. The vital takeaway is to launch a product quickly and iterate. This involves releasing a product to customers, learning whether it solves their problems or not, and then improving it over time. This route of quick launch and iteration is preferred to longer pathways involving numerous surveys, extensive competitor analysis, time-consuming fundraising, and large-scale hiring. While these may be perceived intelligent measures, they may steer you away from the core goal with an MVP, which is learning about your users. This learning only truly commences when there's a product in the users' hands. Bear in mind, an MVP may not work initially, but it serves as an initiating point of conversation to understand better and solve user problems. Remember, building an MVP is about assessing, prioritizing tasks, and above all, focusing on the user.\n",

Both types of founders may arrive at the correct decision in the end, but their paths differ significantly.

The wrong answer is to do a hundred surveys and 600 user interviews and contact every single 1 of the competitors and spend, you know, a year fundraising and hire a hundred people and, you know, all these other things that you can distract yourself with.

But in reality, they really don't highlight the most important point about an MVP, which is you'd only really start learning about your user when you put a product in front of it.

      "Embarking on building an MVP implies adopting some best practices. The most notable one involves swiftly launching and iterating the product. To ensure that the product meets the need of your users, appropriate practice is to deploy a product quickly and embark on an iterative improvement process over time as you gain insights into how it benefits your users or not. Avoid falling into time-consuming pitfalls that can distract from the main focus, such as conducting excessive surveys, user interviews, competitor consultations, prolonged fundraising, or overextending in recruitment. Remember that while these steps may appear beneficial, they often fail to emphasize the fundamental aspect of an MVP - learning about your user primarily commences when they interact with your product. This process doesn't guarantee that the first version of your MVP will be successful. However, it is the most effective method to initiate conversations with your users on how you can better solve their problems.\n",

      "So another reason So people, especially if they've already had a job at another company, you tend to develop this narrative of like, okay, like, the people running this company are idiots. They're making all these stupid decisions. They're spending their time in in these stupid ways. I'm gonna start a company and I'm gonna do it better. I'm gonna, like, set all the rules. It's a pretty attractive idea. Makes a lot of sense. If you've read my medium post, you know, it's coming. I'll give you guys a second to read this quote. Cool. So this this really resonates with me. And 1 thing I'd point out is, you know, the reality of these decisions is pretty new, nuanced. The people you thought were idiots probably weren't idiots. They probably just had like really difficult decision in front of them, and people pulling them in multiple directions. So the most common thing I have to spend my time on and and focus my energy on as as a CEO is like the the problems that, like, other people are bringing to me the other priorities that people create. And it's usually in the form of a conflict. People wanna go in different directions or like customers want different things, and like I might have my own opinion about that. But really, the the game I'm playing is like, who do I disappoint the least? And like, trying to, like, navigate all all these difficult situations. And even on a day to day basis, I might come in on Monday and, like, have all these you know, grand plans for, like, how I'm gonna improve the company when I'm gonna spend my time on. But then if, like, an important employee is threatening to quit, that's where I'm spending my time on. That's my number 1 priority.\n",

      "When starting a company, many people believe they can do a better job than the existing management. They may develop a narrative that the current leaders are making foolish decisions and wasting their time. However, it's important to recognize that the reality of decision-making in a company is often complex and nuanced. The people you may perceive as idiots are likely facing difficult choices and being pulled in multiple directions. As a CEO, one of the biggest challenges is dealing with conflicts and managing the priorities set by others. It becomes a game of determining who to disappoint the least and navigating through these difficult situations. Even the best-laid plans may need to be adjusted if important employees are threatening to quit or if emergencies arise.\n"
