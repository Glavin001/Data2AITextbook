       " 'story': 'New York (CNN) -- More than 80 Michael Jackson collectibles -- including the late pop star\\'s famous rhinestone-studded glove from a 1983 performance -- were auctioned off Saturday, reaping a total $2 million. \\n\\nProfits from the auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York\\'s Times Square crushed pre-sale expectations of only $120,000 in sales. \\n\\nThe highly prized memorabilia, which included items spanning the many stages of Jackson\\'s career, came from more than 30 fans, associates and family members, who contacted Julien\\'s Auctions to sell their gifts and mementos of the singer. \\n\\nJackson\\'s flashy glove was the big-ticket item of the night, fetching $420,000 from a buyer in Hong Kong, China. Jackson wore the glove at a 1983 performance during \"Motown 25,\" an NBC special where he debuted his revolutionary moonwalk. \\n\\nFellow Motown star Walter \"Clyde\" Orange of the Commodores, who also performed in the special 26 years ago, said he asked for Jackson\\'s autograph at the time, but Jackson gave him the glove instead. \\n\\n\"The legacy that [Jackson] left behind is bigger than life for me,\" Orange said. \"I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music.\" \\n\\nOrange said he plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity. \\n\\nHoffman Ma, who bought the glove on behalf of Ponte 16 Resort in Macau, paid a 25 percent buyer\\'s premium, which was tacked onto all final sales over $50,000. Winners of items less than $50,000 paid a 20 percent premium. ',\n",

       " 'story': ['The Vatican Apostolic Library (), more commonly called the Vatican Library or simply the Vat, is the library of the Holy See, located in Vatican City. Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It has 75,000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. \\n\\nThe Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science and theology. The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail. \\n\\nIn March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four-year project of digitising its collection of manuscripts, to be made available online. \\n\\nThe Vatican Secret Archives were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century; they contain another 150,000 items. \\n\\nScholars have traditionally divided the history of the library into five periods, Pre-Lateran, Lateran, Avignon, Pre-Vatican and Vatican. \\n\\nThe Pre-Lateran period, comprising the initial days of the library, dated from the earliest days of the Church. Only a handful of volumes survive from this period, though some are very significant.',\n",
       "  'New York (CNN) -- More than 80 Michael Jackson collectibles -- including the late pop star\\'s famous rhinestone-studded glove from a 1983 performance -- were auctioned off Saturday, reaping a total $2 million. \\n\\nProfits from the auction at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York\\'s Times Square crushed pre-sale expectations of only $120,000 in sales. \\n\\nThe highly prized memorabilia, which included items spanning the many stages of Jackson\\'s career, came from more than 30 fans, associates and family members, who contacted Julien\\'s Auctions to sell their gifts and mementos of the singer. \\n\\nJackson\\'s flashy glove was the big-ticket item of the night, fetching $420,000 from a buyer in Hong Kong, China. Jackson wore the glove at a 1983 performance during \"Motown 25,\" an NBC special where he debuted his revolutionary moonwalk. \\n\\nFellow Motown star Walter \"Clyde\" Orange of the Commodores, who also performed in the special 26 years ago, said he asked for Jackson\\'s autograph at the time, but Jackson gave him the glove instead. \\n\\n\"The legacy that [Jackson] left behind is bigger than life for me,\" Orange said. \"I hope that through that glove people can see what he was trying to say in his music and what he said in his music.\" \\n\\nOrange said he plans to give a portion of the proceeds to charity. \\n\\nHoffman Ma, who bought the glove on behalf of Ponte 16 Resort in Macau, paid a 25 percent buyer\\'s premium, which was tacked onto all final sales over $50,000. Winners of items less than $50,000 paid a 20 percent premium. '],\n",

Formally established in 1475, although it is much older, it is one of the oldest libraries in the world and contains one of the most significant collections of historical texts. It has 75,000 codices from throughout history, as well as 1.1 million printed books, which include some 8,500 incunabula. \\n\\nThe Vatican Library is a research library for history, law, philosophy, science and theology. The Vatican Library is open to anyone who can document their qualifications and research needs. Photocopies for private study of pages from books published between 1801 and 1990 can be requested in person or by mail. \\n\\nIn March 2014, the Vatican Library began an initial four-year project of digitising its collection of manuscripts, to be made available online. \\n\\nThe Vatican Secret Archives were separated from the library at the beginning of the 17th century; they contain another 150,000 items. \\n\\nScholars have traditionally divided the history of the library into five periods, Pre-Lateran, Lateran, Avignon, Pre-Vatican and Vatican. \\n\\nThe Pre-Lateran period, comprising the initial days of the library, dated from the earliest days of the Church.
